# Bucket

Bucket is a simple bucketlist application built using Angular2.

It consumes an API built with Django Rest Framework. You can take a look at the API's repo [here](https://github.com/andela-rwachira/cp3/tree/develop).

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.24.

## Install

These are the basic steps to install and run the app locally on a linux system:

Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) which comes with npm package manager built in. 

Clone the repo from GitHub: `$ git clone https://github.com/andela-rwachira/bucket-app.git`.

CD into the cloned root folder and run `npm install` to install the package dependencies then `npm start` to start the application.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Make sure you follow the instructions to run the [API's server](https://github.com/andela-rwachira/cp3/tree/develop) as well, otherwise this app will not be able to send/receive data.
